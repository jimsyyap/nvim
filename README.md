# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

my customized version of LazyVim

## TODO

- upon update, getting error, colorscheme not found. reinstall lazynvim, adding old configs step at a time
- missing droids could be in gitsigns.nvim. See https://www.lazyvim.org/plugins/editor
- left sidebar with numbers too wide? How to fix (actually, not so bad)
- Create colorscheme.lua for all color config
- Howto colorscheme flavor of the month?

### change/updates

- text.lua seems to be culprit modifiable error. Fix? mv file to ftdetect...joy
- test plugins/disabled.lua, disabled gitsigns. After save, the thing on left sidebar doesnt show anymore. Joy?
- MasonInstalled clangd, tsserver 18jun2024
- updated ai.lua for codeium keymaps 16jun2024
- added fold.vim to ftdetect. Za toggles fold on indent 16jun2024
- date autocomplete is in copilot, not nvim-cmp
- emmet-language-server installed, as required, see emmet.lua
    . emmet works, remapped copilot from ai.lua
- stylua.toml indent_type = tabs 09jun2024, as per go fmt
- replaced lexima with windwp/nvim-autopairs 09jun2024..joy
- disabled swapfiles, plugins.keymaps
